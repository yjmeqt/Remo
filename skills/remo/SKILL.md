# Remo

Use this skill for the normal development loop after setup is complete.

Read `references/cli.md` before running commands, when you need exact CLI syntax, or when you are considering `remo mirror --save` and need to account for its current timing caveat.

## Core Loop

Follow this loop for each task:

1. Connect to the running app.
2. Capture a baseline.
3. Make a code change.
4. Rebuild and checkpoint with screenshots, view trees, or capability calls.
5. Record pass or fail evidence in a verification report.
6. Repeat until the task is verified.

## Step 1: Connect

Discover the app, store the current address, and verify connectivity before writing the report.

Use `references/cli.md` for the exact commands. At minimum:

- discover devices
- ping the selected target
- capture device and app metadata

## Step 2: Start a Verification Session

Create a task-specific directory:

```text
.remo/verifications/<task-id>/
  report.md
  assets/
```

Use a short task identifier such as `fix-avatar-radius` or `add-settings-screen`.

Record these fields in the report header:

- date and time
- device name and OS
- app bundle ID and version
- branch name

## Step 3: Capture the Baseline

Before making changes, capture the current screen and any supporting state that will matter later.

Typical baseline evidence:

- screenshot
- view tree
- capability output for relevant internal state

Add a short observation describing what is wrong or what you expect to change.

## Step 4: Checkpoint After Each Change

After each meaningful build:

1. capture a screenshot
2. capture the view tree if layout or navigation changed
3. call relevant verification capabilities if internal state matters
4. compare the result against your expectation
5. mark the step as pass or fail

Every failed checkpoint gets its own report entry. Do not overwrite failed evidence.

## Step 5: Add Verification Nodes When Needed

If the UI does not expose enough information, register debug-only verification capabilities.

Good candidates:

- read hidden internal state
- force a specific state such as empty, error, or logged out
- navigate directly to a screen
- seed test data

Pattern:

```swift
#if DEBUG
import RemoSwift

Remo.register("verify.feed_count") { _ in
    ["count": FeedRepository.shared.items.count]
}
#endif
```

Keep verification capabilities inside debug-only code and return structured JSON. `Remo.register` handlers execute on a background callback path, so any UI mutation or actor-isolated work must be explicitly handed off instead of performed directly in the callback.

All app-side Remo code should stay under `#if DEBUG`, including imports, startup hooks, and verification capability registration.

## Step 6: Write the Summary

End each verification with a summary table covering:

- baseline captured
- each checkpoint
- pass or fail status
- total steps

The report should let another reviewer understand exactly what changed and what was verified without rerunning the task.

## Verification Modes

Choose the lightest mode that proves the behavior:

- screenshot for visual checks
- tree for structure and hierarchy
- capability call for hidden state
- multi-screen navigation checks for regression coverage
- mirror only when a moving interaction matters

If you use `remo mirror --save`, check `references/cli.md` first. The saved video currently compresses idle periods and is not a wall-clock-accurate recording format.
