# README Improvement Plan

Optimizations to make the repo more attractive and increase GitHub stars.

## High Priority

### 1. Hero visual (demo GIF/video)
30-second recording: left side terminal with agent running commands, right side simulator UI reacting. More persuasive than any text. Place at the very top of README after tagline.

### 2. "The Problem" section — paint the pain
Add a before/after contrast before "Why Remo?". Something like:
> AI agents can write Swift code and trigger builds — but they're blind.
> They can't see the screen, can't verify UI changes, can't tap buttons.
> Every iOS iteration still needs a human to look at the simulator and say "looks right."
> Remo closes this gap.

### 3. Sharper tagline
"Infrastructure for agentic iOS development" is technically accurate but forgettable. Consider:
- "Give your AI agent eyes and hands on iOS."
- "Let AI agents see and control iOS apps."

### 4. Badges
Add CI status, version, license, platform badges at the top. Without badges the repo looks immature to GitHub users scanning READMEs.

## Medium Priority

### 5. Shorter Quick Start
Current 4 steps → aim for "3 lines to get running". SPM dependency + 2 lines Swift + 1 CLI command. Lower the barrier.

### 6. Positioning / comparison table
Users will ask "how is this different from Appium / XCTest / accessibility inspector?" A brief table clarifying: Remo is not a test framework — it's the perception layer for AI agents.

| | Remo | Appium | XCTest |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary user | AI agents | QA engineers | Developers |
| Setup | Embed SDK, zero config | WebDriver server | Xcode project |
| Capabilities | Custom Swift handlers | UI automation | Unit/UI tests |
| Visual feedback | Screenshot + video | Screenshot | None |

## Low Priority

### 7. "Built with Remo" / use case showcase
Once real users exist, add a section showing real agent workflows or integrations.

### 8. Animated architecture diagram
Replace ASCII art with a cleaner SVG or Mermaid diagram.
