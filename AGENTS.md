## What is Remo

Remo is infrastructure for **agentic iOS development** — it gives AI agents eyes and hands to autonomously build, test, and debug iOS apps. iOS apps embed the Remo SDK (a Rust static library), which starts a TCP server exposing registered **capabilities** (named handlers). macOS clients (CLI, web dashboard, AI agents) discover devices via USB (usbmuxd) or Bonjour/mDNS and invoke capabilities, inspect the view tree, capture screenshots, or record video.

## Build Commands

```bash
make setup          # Configure git hooks (run once after clone)
make build          # Build workspace (debug)
make check          # Type-check only (cargo check)
make test           # Run all tests (cargo test)
make lint           # Clippy with -D warnings
make fmt            # Auto-format (cargo fmt)
make cli            # Build macOS CLI binary (release) → target/release/remo
make ios-sim        # XCFramework for arm64 simulator only (~16s, local dev)
make ios-device     # XCFramework for arm64 device only (~16s)
make ios            # Full XCFramework, all targets, release (~50s, CI)
```

Device-dependent tests are `#[ignore]`d by default. Run with `cargo test -- --ignored` when a device is connected.

To run a single Rust test: `cargo test -p <crate-name> <test_name>`

E2E test (builds SDK + CLI + app, launches on simulator, exercises all capabilities):
```bash
./scripts/e2e-test.sh                     # full run
SKIP_BUILD=1 ./scripts/e2e-test.sh        # skip build phase
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --screenshots       # save screenshots to /tmp/remo-e2e/
```

## Architecture

### Crate topology (dependency order)

```
remo-protocol      — Message types (Request/Response/Event), framing codec
remo-transport     — Framed TCP/Unix socket bidirectional connection
remo-usbmuxd      — macOS USB device discovery via /var/run/usbmuxd
remo-bonjour       — DNS-SD wrapper for Bonjour discovery & registration
remo-objc          — ObjC runtime bridge (view tree, screenshot, device/app info)
remo-sdk           — iOS embedded TCP server + capability registry + FFI boundary
remo-desktop       — macOS device manager, RPC client, web dashboard, fMP4 muxer
remo-daemon        — Background daemon: connection pool, HTTP/WS API, event bus
remo-cli           — CLI entry point (clap), delegates to remo-desktop/remo-daemon
```

### Wire protocol

Length-prefixed framing: `[u32 BE length][u8 type][payload]`. Three frame types:
- `0x00` JSON — JSON-RPC messages (Request, Response, Event)
- `0x01` Binary — raw bytes (screenshots)
- `0x02` Stream — H.264 NALUs for video streaming

### FFI boundary (remo-sdk → Swift)

The `remo-sdk` crate compiles to a C static library for iOS. Seven exported C functions: `remo_start`, `remo_stop`, `remo_register_capability`, `remo_unregister_capability`, `remo_free_string`, `remo_list_capabilities`, `remo_get_port`. The C header is manually maintained at `swift/RemoSwift/Sources/RemoSwift/include/remo.h`.

The Rust side owns a global `OnceLock<Mutex<RemoGlobal>>` holding the tokio runtime, capability registry, and server state. `remo_start()` is idempotent. Main-thread work (UIKit access) is dispatched via GCD `dispatch_sync_f`.

### Swift layer

`swift/RemoSwift/` wraps the C FFI in a Swift-friendly API. The `RemoSDK.xcframework` is the binary artifact distributed via the `remo-spm` repo. `REMO_LOCAL=1` env var switches example app to use local monorepo source instead of the published SPM package.

The SDK is `#if DEBUG` only — it does not ship in release builds.

### Example app (examples/ios/)

Workspace + SPM package architecture: the Xcode project (`RemoExample/`) is a thin shell; all feature code lives in `RemoExamplePackage/`. See `swift/CLAUDE.md` for Swift/SwiftUI conventions (MV pattern, no ViewModels, Swift Testing, @Observable).

## Code Style

- **Rust**: `rustfmt.toml` enforces max_width=100. Workspace clippy lints are in `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `undocumented_unsafe_blocks`, `await_holding_lock`, `large_futures`).
- **Swift**: See `swift/CLAUDE.md` for full guidelines. Key points: MV pattern (no ViewModels), Swift Testing (`@Test`/`#expect`), Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`): runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy`. Set up with `make setup`.

## CI

GitHub Actions on `macos-26`. Two jobs: check (fmt + clippy + unit tests), e2e (build SDK/CLI/app, launch on simulator, exercise all capabilities via `scripts/e2e-test.sh`). Release workflow builds XCFramework, creates GitHub release, and auto-updates `remo-spm` repo.
